Commons.Locale.GetOptions
============================

Managed Commons library for command line arguments parsing. 

It is the evolution of the years-old Mono.GetOptions library, distributed with [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com). 
I created Mono.GetOptions, but now it is frozen/deprecated in Mono, so the evolution is going to happen in this Managed Commons project.

__Commons.GetOptions 1.0.0 is now available as a Nuget:__ [Commons.GetOptions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Commons.GetOptions/).
